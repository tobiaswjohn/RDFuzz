Can not parse blank node as class

Call to API:
OWLOntologyDocumentSource source = new FileDocumentSource(ontFile, new TurtleDocumentFormat());
OWLOntology ont = manager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(source);


Produced triple:
ClassAssertion(<http://org.semanticweb.owlapi/error#Error1> <file:/home/tobias/Documents/programming/ontologies/RDFuzz/turtle/reduced_bugs/bug2/iri>)


Additional fact:


parsing works if blank node is an IRI.

<iri> a <iri2>.
