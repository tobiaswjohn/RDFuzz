source of problem:

unallowed datatype definition

see https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#The_Restrictions_on_the_Axiom_Closure

"Each datatype occurring in Ax satisfies exactly one of the following conditions: it is rdfs:Literal, or it is contained in the OWL 2 datatype map, or it is defined by a single datatype definition axiom in Ax"


--> this is more a documentation issue
