error in checking profile (in parser?)

--> OWL2DLProfile().checkOntology(ont) returns a violation, although this should be allowed

 - problem is triggered by parser: parsing string as langString in https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/blob/0e7166f4df44d40dbe66d74c3e8710ef4fd5ee4b/impl/src/main/java/uk/ac/manchester/cs/owl/owlapi/OWLLiteralImplPlain.java#L44

 - definitions a bit unclear:
  	- according to RDF1.2 standard, it seems like this should be parsed as langString is correct https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/#section-Graph-Literal
  	- OWL DL standard explains with examples how this is allowed https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#BNF_Notation
  	- OWL DL standard does not list langStrings as allowed datatypes https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Strings





call:
OWLOntologyDocumentSource source = new FileDocumentSource(ontFile, new FunctionalSyntaxDocumentFormat());
OWLOntologyManager manager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager();
ont = manager.loadOntologyFromOntologyDocument(source);


OWLProfileReport profileReport = new OWL2DLProfile().checkOntology(ont);
List<OWLProfileViolation> violations = profileReport.getViolations();
