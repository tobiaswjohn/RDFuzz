This issue is about error handling. The ontology contains an ontology that is not according to the OWL standard as an axiom redefines the datatype \texttt{rdfs:Literal}. However, HermiT does not raise any warnings when working with the ontology while this error affects the inferences in general. (E.g., HermiT incorrectly infers the axiom \texttt{EquivalentDataProperties(:d owl:bottomDataProperty)} for the provided ontology). We think it would be helpful to raise some warning that the ontology is not according to the specification and that the inferences might contain errors.
